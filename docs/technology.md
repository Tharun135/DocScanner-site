# üîß Technology Architecture

Deep dive into DocScanner's 3-tier RAG architecture and local AI implementation.

---

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

DocScanner uses a revolutionary 3-tier approach that combines traditional rule-based analysis with cutting-edge RAG technology.

    D --> E[Vector Knowledge Search]
    E --> F[Local AI Processing]
    F --> G[Enhanced Suggestions]
    G --> H[Smart Fallback System]
```

### Tier 1: Traditional Rule Engine

**Built-in Writing Rules (39+):**

- **Grammar Rules**: Passive voice, subject-verb agreement, word choice
- **Style Rules**: Sentence length, readability, consistency
- **Format Rules**: Punctuation, capitalization, structure

**Implementation:**
- spaCy NLP for dependency parsing
- Regex patterns for style detection
- Statistical analysis for readability metrics

### Tier 2: RAG Enhancement

**Knowledge Base Integration:**

DocScanner searches through its knowledge base to find the most relevant writing rules for your specific situation. It then uses local AI to create personalized suggestions that understand your document's context and purpose.

The system combines:
- Context understanding from your document
- Relevant writing rules from the knowledge base  
- AI-powered suggestion generation
- Quality scoring to ensure reliability

### Tier 3: Smart Fallback

**Reliability Guarantee:**

If the AI system encounters any issues or if the confidence level is too low, DocScanner automatically falls back to traditional rule-based suggestions. This ensures you always get helpful feedback, no matter what.

## ü§ñ AI Model Integration

### Local Model Support

| Model | Parameters | Size | Use Case |
|-------|------------|------|----------|
| **Mistral** | 7B | 4.4GB | Balanced quality/speed |
| **Llama3** | 8B | 4.7GB | Maximum quality |
| **Phi3** | 3.8B | 2.2GB | Resource-efficient |
| **TinyLLaMA** | 1.1B | 637MB | Always available |

### Ollama Integration

DocScanner uses Ollama to run AI models locally on your computer. This means:

- **Privacy First** - Your documents never go to external servers
- **Always Available** - No internet connection required after setup
- **Multiple Models** - Choose the best model for your hardware
- **Automatic Management** - DocScanner handles all the technical details

### Automatic Model Selection

DocScanner automatically chooses the best AI model based on your computer's memory:

- **8GB+ RAM** - Uses Llama3 for highest quality suggestions
- **4GB+ RAM** - Uses Mistral for balanced performance
- **2GB+ RAM** - Uses Phi3 for efficient processing
- **Any System** - TinyLLaMA works on minimal hardware

---

## üìö Knowledge Base Architecture

### Vector Database (ChromaDB)

**Writing Rules Storage:**

DocScanner stores all writing rules in a special database that understands the meaning of text. When you upload a document, the system searches this database to find the most relevant rules for your specific writing issues.

The database contains:
- Writing rule descriptions and examples
- Categories for different types of issues
- Context information about when to apply each rule
- Examples of good and bad writing patterns

### Knowledge Base Sources

**Built-in Rules:**

- Grammar rules with examples
- Style guidelines
- Format standards
- Readability principles

**Custom Knowledge:**

- Organization style guides
- Industry-specific terminology
- Historical document patterns
- Brand voice guidelines

---

## üîÑ RAG Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process

**1. Issue Detection:** Traditional rules scan your document and find potential writing issues

**2. Knowledge Search:** The system searches the knowledge base for the most relevant writing rules

**3. Context Building:** DocScanner gathers information about your document type and the specific writing issue

**4. AI Generation:** The local AI model creates personalized suggestions based on all the collected information

**5. Quality Control:** If the AI suggestion meets quality standards, it's presented to you. Otherwise, the system uses traditional rule-based suggestions

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Security

### Local Processing

**Complete Privacy:**
- All AI models run locally via Ollama
- No external API calls for analysis
- Documents never leave your infrastructure
- Zero data collection or telemetry

**Data Flow:**

Document ‚Üí Local Analysis ‚Üí Local AI ‚Üí Results (Nothing transmitted externally)

### Security Architecture

**Encryption:**
- Documents encrypted at rest
- HTTPS for all communications
- Secure session management

**Access Control:**
- Role-based permissions
- Authentication integration (LDAP, SAML)
- Audit logging for compliance

---

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

### Processing Speed

**Typical Performance:**
- Small documents (1-5 pages): 5-15 seconds
- Medium documents (10-20 pages): 30-60 seconds
- Large documents (50+ pages): 2-5 minutes

**Optimization Techniques:**
- Parallel rule processing
- Model pre-loading
- Result caching
- Background processing

### Resource Management

**Memory Usage:**

DocScanner automatically manages system resources by selecting the appropriate AI model based on available memory. It monitors your system and chooses the best model that will run smoothly without affecting other applications.

**CPU Optimization:**

- Multi-threading for rule processing
- Async processing for AI requests  
- Queue management for batch jobs

---

## üîß Integration Architecture

### RESTful API

DocScanner provides a simple API that allows other applications to analyze documents programmatically. The API handles file uploads, model selection, and returns structured results that can be easily integrated into existing workflows.

### Webhook Support

DocScanner can notify external systems when document analysis is complete, allowing integration with workflow management systems and automated processes.

---

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### System Health

DocScanner provides built-in monitoring that tracks:
- Available models and their status
- Memory usage and system resources
- Processing queue length and performance
- Average response times for different operations

### Performance Metrics

- Document processing throughput
- Model response times
- Memory utilization
- Error rates and success metrics

1. Try Mistral (best balance of quality/speed)
2. Fall back to Phi3 if memory constrained
3. Use TinyLLaMA as guaranteed working option
4. Use rule-based suggestions if all AI fails

## üîå Integration Points

### 1. Rule Integration

Every writing rule in DocScanner now uses this enhanced approach:

**Before**: Simple rule detection that only identifies problems
**After**: RAG-enhanced system with smart fallback that provides context-aware suggestions

If RAG system is available, it provides intelligent suggestions. If not, traditional rule-based suggestions ensure you always get helpful feedback.

### 2. Web Interface Integration

The frontend now displays enhanced suggestions with confidence levels and source information, helping users understand whether suggestions come from AI analysis or traditional rules.

---

## üéØ Real Example: How It Works

### Input Document
"The configuration settings were updated by the development team."

### Processing Steps

#### 1. Rule Detection
- **Issue**: Passive voice detected ("were updated by")
- **Rule**: Traditional grammar rule identifies passive voice structure

#### 2. Vector Search
The system searches the knowledge base for rules about passive voice conversion and finds relevant examples and patterns.

#### 3. AI Enhancement
- **Prompt**: Local AI model receives context about fixing passive voice
- **Result**: "The development team updated the configuration settings."

#### 4. Output
DocScanner presents the original text, suggested improvement, confidence level, and explains that it came from local AI processing.
